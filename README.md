# Garden Minder

## Front-end Capstone Project by Brian Neal

## After I clone this repo, what do I need to do to setup and run this project?

1. run `npm install` in the root directory of repo
2. `npm start` will start the react project
3. create an `api` directory from your repo root directory, along with a `database.json` file
4. from the api directory, run the command `json-server -p 3003 -w database.json` to start your JSON server
